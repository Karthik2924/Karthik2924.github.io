## North Carolina State University
**Greaduate Research Assistant @ North Carolina State University**

*August 2023 - Present*
- Proposed a new formulation of Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder(VQVAE) to disentangle data using labels for just ~1% of the
dataset and unsupervised fine tuning for the rest.
- Achieved state of the art performance for latent space disentanglement with InfoM, InfoE, InfoC scores over 0.9 for 3 major benchmark
disentanglement datasets. Research paper under review at UAI 2024.
- Conducted experiments on various representation learning and generative models such as VAEs and GANs.
- Reproduced generative models on compressed representations from Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders(VQVAE) and analyzed
various methods to disentangle different attributes of the data in latent space

## Skylark Labs
**Machine Learning Engineer Intern @ [Skylark Labs](https://skylarklabs.ai/)**

*June 2023 - August 2023*

- Designed and developed a continual learning framework for object recognition from scratch using PyTorch.
- Trained the framework to overcome catastrophic forgetting i.e learn new objects or samples while retaining the old ones.
- Utilized pretrained yolo-v8 for coarse grained object detection of generic objects and built a vector database for fine grained instances.
- Improved the speed and efficiency of the vector database search by using approximate nearest neighbor search with FAISS.

## North Carolina State University CSC
**Teaching Assistant @ North Carolina State University**

*January 2023 - May 2023*
- Developed well documented solutions for continuous and discrete optimization problems using nature inspired heuristic algorithms.
- Designed an evaluation strategy to test various heuristic algorithms in both continuous and discrete domains to measure their robustness.
- Helped students clarify any doubts regarding the concept as well as implementation of algorithms.

## National Institute of Ocean Technology
**Student Intern @ [NIOT]([https://research.ece.ncsu.edu/aros/](https://www.niot.res.in/)), India**

*January 2021 - April 2021*

- Performed underwater image enhancement on deep sea images obtained by an ROV
- Fine-tuned large deep learning models based on GAN FuNIE-GAN and convolutional neural networks UW-CNN to the small dataset available.
- Implemented a physics based dehaze model for image enhancement using the popular Dark Channel Prior algorithm.
-  Made no reference image quality comparisons for all the different methods used and assessed runtimes to make recommendations.

## Samsung
**Research Intern @ [Samsung PRISM](https://www.samsungprism.com/) India**

*September 2001 - March 2020*

- Developed a hybrid sound classification engine using log-Mel audio features to detect artificial sounds as well as identify spoofed voice.
- Trained a neural network using Residual Squeeze and excitation network.
- Achieved an EER of 4.44 on the ASVSpoof2019 evaluation set.
- Presented Research in ICCNT 2021 Conference. [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9580127)

## Shunya OS
**Ai Intern @ [Shunya OS/iotiot.in](https://www.iotiot.in) India**

*July 2020 - October 2020*

- Designed and developed speech to text software which tackles speaker separation.
- Used large open-source pre-trained speaker diarization model for speaker separation and DeepSpeech a speech to text model to build the pipeline
