I am Karthik Sanka, a machine learning engineer and researcher with a Master's degree in Computer Science from North Carolina State University. I specialize in developing neural networks and generative models to solve complex problems with data-driven approaches. My work focuses on the robustness and interpretability of deep learning models, particularly in unsupervised and weakly supervised settings.

I have contributed to advancements in AI through roles such as Graduate Research Assistant at NC State, where I achieved state-of-the-art performance in latent space disentanglement, and as a Machine Learning Intern at Skylark Labs, where I developed frameworks to overcome catastrophic forgetting. My technical expertise includes Python, C++, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

I am passionate about leveraging AI to drive innovation and deliver impactful solutions.
