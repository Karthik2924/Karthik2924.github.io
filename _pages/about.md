As a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Computer Science from North Carolina State University, I bring a robust skill set in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. With a stellar academic record and hands-on experience in various projects and internships, I have honed my abilities in developing innovative solutions to complex problems.
During my tenure as a Graduate Research Assistant, I developed interpretable codebooks for Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE), achieving state-of-the-art performance in latent space disentanglement.  Additionally, my experience as a Machine Learning Intern at Skylark Labs allowed me to design and implement a continual learning framework for object recognition, demonstrating my ability to innovate in real-world applications.
I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, C++, and R, and I am proficient in frameworks and technologies including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. My passion for research extends beyond academia, as evidenced by my involvement in projects like Contrastive Curriculum Augmentation Framework for Self-Supervised Learning and Probabilistic Graph Residual, both of which were published in reputable conferences.
I am now seeking new opportunities to leverage my skills and expertise in a dynamic environment where I can continue to grow professionally and make meaningful contributions to cutting-edge projects.
